360 Project

This project was done in a group of four. We implemented a Conference Manager System from user stories. This system has many different roles (Program Chair, Subprogram Chair, Author, etc.) that are assigned to do different tasks involved with a variety of conferences. This project was done in an Agile Environment. This was done in Java on Eclipse.
